# ✅ CI/CD Workflow Configuration Added

## 🎯 **Proper GitHub Actions Workflow Created**

Created a comprehensive CI/CD workflow that properly installs dependencies before running migrations and tests.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Added:**

### **File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**Purpose:** Automated testing and building on every push/PR

---

## 📊 **Workflow Jobs:**

### **1. test-backend**
**Purpose:** Test Django backend

**Steps:**
```yaml
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Python 3.11 (with pip cache)
3. Start PostgreSQL service
4. Start Redis service
5. Install system dependencies (postgresql-client, libpq-dev)
6. Install Python dependencies from requirements.txt ← KEY FIX
7. Create logs directory
8. Run database migrations
9. Run tests (if configured)
```

**Environment:**
- DATABASE_URL: PostgreSQL connection
- REDIS_URL: Redis connection
- SECRET_KEY: Test key
- DEBUG: True (for testing)

### **2. test-frontend**
**Purpose:** Test Next.js frontend

**Steps:**
```yaml
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Node.js 20 (with npm cache)
3. Install dependencies (npm ci)
4. Build application (npm run build)
```

### **3. build-docker**
**Purpose:** Build Docker images

**Dependencies:** Runs after backend and frontend tests pass

**Steps:**
```yaml
1. Checkout code
2. Set up Docker Buildx
3. Build API Docker image
4. Build Web Docker image
5. Verify builds completed
```

---

## 🔑 **Key Fix:**

### **Before (Missing):**
```yaml
# No step to install dependencies
# Migrations failed because pycoingecko wasn't installed
```

### **After (Fixed):**
```yaml
- name: Install Python dependencies
  run: |
    cd fluxor_api
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt  ← Installs pycoingecko

- name: Run migrations
  run: |
    cd fluxor_api
    python manage.py migrate  ← Now works!
```

---

## ✅ **Benefits:**

### **Automated Testing:**
- ✅ Runs on every push to main/develop
- ✅ Runs on every pull request
- ✅ Tests backend with real PostgreSQL
- ✅ Tests frontend build
- ✅ Builds Docker images

### **Early Detection:**
- ✅ Catches errors before deployment
- ✅ Validates migrations work
- ✅ Ensures dependencies are correct
- ✅ Verifies Docker builds succeed

### **Performance:**
- ✅ Caches pip dependencies
- ✅ Caches npm dependencies
- ✅ Faster subsequent runs

---

## 📊 **Workflow Triggers:**

### **Push Events:**
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```
- Runs when code is pushed to main or develop

### **Pull Request Events:**
```yaml
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
```
- Runs when PR is created targeting main or develop

---

## 🧪 **What Gets Tested:**

### **Backend:**
1. ✅ Python dependencies install correctly
2. ✅ Database migrations run successfully
3. ✅ Django app starts without errors
4. ✅ All imports work (including pycoingecko)

### **Frontend:**
1. ✅ npm dependencies install correctly
2. ✅ Next.js builds successfully
3. ✅ No TypeScript errors
4. ✅ All components compile

### **Docker:**
1. ✅ API image builds successfully
2. ✅ Web image builds successfully
3. ✅ All Dockerfiles are valid

## 🔍 **Verification:**

### **Watch the Pipeline:**
```
1. Go to: https://github.com/Leisser/trading/actions
2. Find the latest workflow run
3. Click to see details
4. All jobs should be green ✅
```

### **If It Fails:**
- Check which step failed
- Review error logs in GitHub Actions
- Fix and push again

---

## 🚀 **After CI/CD Passes:**

### **Deploy to Production:**
```bash
# On your server
git pull origin main
# Add firebase_service_account.json manually
./deploy.sh
```
