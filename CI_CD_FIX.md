# ✅ CI/CD Pipeline Fix

## 🎯 **Issue Resolved**

Fixed the CI/CD pipeline failure caused by missing/outdated pycoingecko module.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Wrong:**

**Error:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pycoingecko'
```

**Cause:**
- requirements.txt had `pycoingecko==3.1.0`
- We installed `pycoingecko==3.2.0` locally
- CI/CD was trying to use 3.1.0 which had issues

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

**Updated:** `fluxor_api/requirements.txt`
```python
# BEFORE
pycoingecko==3.1.0

# AFTER
pycoingecko==3.2.0
```

**Also Added:** `fluxor_api/firebase_service_account.json` to `.gitignore`
