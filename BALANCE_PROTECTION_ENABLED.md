## 🔧 **What Changed:**

### **Backend - Balance Deduction DISABLED:**

**File:** `fluxor_api/trades/views.py`

**Line 1105-1107 (DeductBalanceView):**
```python
# BEFORE (❌ Deducted balance)
with db_transaction.atomic():
    # Deduct from balance
    usdt_balance.balance -= amount
    usdt_balance.save()

# AFTER (✅ NO deduction)
with db_transaction.atomic():
    # DON'T deduct from balance - strategy trades are simulated only
    # usdt_balance.balance -= amount  # DISABLED
    # usdt_balance.save()  # DISABLED
```

**Line 1187-1190 (StopTradeView):**
```python
# BEFORE (❌ Returned balance)
old_balance = usdt_balance.balance
usdt_balance.balance += amount_to_return
usdt_balance.save()

# AFTER (✅ NO return needed)
old_balance = usdt_balance.balance
# usdt_balance.balance += amount_to_return  # DISABLED
# usdt_balance.save()  # DISABLED
```

## 🛡️ **Frontend - Updated Notices:**

### **Strategy Trading Information:**
```
ⓘ Strategy Trading Information
Strategy trades are simulated and DO NOT affect your wallet 
balance. All strategies default to "Hold" mode. The trade_sum 
decreases as trades execute, and trading stops when it reaches 
zero. Strategies persist even when you close the browser.
```

### **Wallet Protection Active:**
```
✅ Wallet Protection Active
Strategy trades are 100% simulated and will NOT deduct from 
or add to your wallet balance. Your USDT balance remains 
completely safe. The trade_sum decreases as simulated trades 
execute, stopping automatically when it reaches zero.
```

### **Trade History:**
```
ⓘ Trade History
This section shows your trade history. Strategy Trades (above) 
are simulated and don't affect your wallet balance. Only actual 
wallet trades impact your USDT balance.
```

### **Creating a Strategy:**
```
1. User fills form:
   - Pair: BTC/USD
   - Amount: 1.0 BTC
   - Leverage: 10x
   
2. Frontend calculates costs (for display only)
   
3. API called: POST /api/trading/deduct-balance/
   ↓
4. Backend:
   - Validates user is authenticated ✅
   - Creates Trade record ✅
   - Does NOT deduct balance ✅✅✅
   - Returns success
   ↓
5. Frontend:

   - Saves to localStorage
   - Displays in UI
   ↓
6. User Balance:
   - Before: $10,000
   - After: $10,000  ✅ UNCHANGED
```

### **Backend Updates (Every 5 Seconds):**
```
Celery Task:
   ↓
1. Updates trade_sum in database
2. Calculates P&L (simulated)
3. Updates price (simulated)
4. Sends WebSocket updates
   ↓
User Balance: UNCHANGED ✅
```

### **Stopping a Trade:**
```
User clicks 🛑 Stop:
   ↓

2. Backend:
   - Updates trade status to 'cancelled'
   - Does NOT return balance (nothing was deducted)
   - Sends WebSocket notification
