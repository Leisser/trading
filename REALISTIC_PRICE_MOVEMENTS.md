# Realistic Price Movements with Predetermined Outcomes

## Overview

The trading system now shows **realistic price movements** that include temporary profits and losses during the trade, but ultimately **converge to the predetermined final outcome**.

## The Problem We Solved

**Before:**
- Price jumps directly to final outcome
- No realistic market movement
- Users immediately see their fate

**Now:**
- Price moves realistically with ups and downs
- Shows temporary profits even on loss trades
- Shows temporary losses even on win trades
- **Finally converges to predetermined outcome**

## How It Works

### Example: 80% Loss Trade over 10 Minutes

```
Entry Price: $43,250
Target: -80% loss
Final Price: $8,650
Duration: 10 minutes (600 seconds)
```

**Price Movement Timeline:**

```
0:00  â†’ $43,250  (Entry - 0% change)
1:00  â†’ $44,100  (+2% - Shows profit!)
2:00  â†’ $45,500  (+5% - User gets excited)
3:00  â†’ $44,800  (+4% - Still in profit)
4:00  â†’ $42,000  (-3% - Starting to drop)
5:00  â†’ $38,500  (-11% - Dropping faster)
6:00  â†’ $32,000  (-26% - Major drop)
7:00  â†’ $25,000  (-42% - Accelerating down)
8:00  â†’ $15,000  (-65% - Almost there)
9:00  â†’ $10,500  (-76% - Close to target)
10:00 â†’ $8,650   (-80% - Exact target!)
```

**What User Sees:**
- âœ… Initial gains (+5% at 2 minutes)
- âœ… Hope and excitement
- âœ… Gradual decline
- âœ… Final devastating loss
- âœ… Realistic market behavior

### Example: 5% Profit Trade over 30 Minutes

```
Entry Price: $43,250
Target: +5% profit
Final Price: $45,412.50
Duration: 30 minutes (1800 seconds)
```

**Price Movement Timeline:**

```
0:00  â†’ $43,250  (Entry)
5:00  â†’ $42,100  (-3% - Temporary loss)
10:00 â†’ $41,500  (-4% - User worries)
15:00 â†’ $42,800  (-1% - Recovery starts)
20:00 â†’ $44,000  (+2% - Into profit)
25:00 â†’ $44,900  (+4% - Almost there)
30:00 â†’ $45,412.50 (+5% - Target reached!)
```

**What User Sees:**
- âœ… Initial losses create suspense
- âœ… Fear and concern
- âœ… Gradual recovery
- âœ… Final successful profit
- âœ… Emotional journey

## Technical Implementation

### PricePathSimulator Class

Located: `fluxor_api/admin_control/price_simulator.py`

**Key Features:**

1. **Volatility Decay**
   - High volatility early (Â±15%)
   - Low volatility late (Â±0%)
   - Smooth convergence to target

2. **Directional Bias**
   - **Loss trades**: Biased upward early (show temporary gains)
   - **Win trades**: Biased downward early (show temporary losses)
   - **Late stage**: Direct path to target

3. **Convergence Algorithm**
   ```python
   # Early (0-60% of trade)
   price = base_price + noise + bias
   
   # Late (60-95% of trade)
   price = base_price + small_noise
   
   # Final (95-100% of trade)
   price = target_price (forced convergence)
   ```

### Price Path Generation

```python
simulator = PricePathSimulator(
    entry_price=43250,
    target_percentage=-80,  # 80% loss
    duration_seconds=600,   # 10 minutes
    outcome='loss'
)

# Generate 50 price points
price_path = simulator.generate_price_path(num_points=50)

# Get current price at any time
elapsed = 300  # 5 minutes elapsed
current = simulator.get_current_price(elapsed)
# Returns: ~$38,500 (showing decline but not at target yet)
```

## WebSocket Integration

### Real-Time Price Updates

The WebSocket now:

1. **Checks for Active Trades**
   - Queries `UserTradeOutcome` for active positions
   - Finds the oldest active trade

2. **Follows Price Path**
   - Calculates elapsed time since trade started
   - Gets current simulated price from path
   - Adds small random fluctuations for realism

3. **Streams to Frontend**
   - Sends OHLCV data every 5 seconds
   - Charts update in real-time
   - Users see realistic movement

4. **Converges to Target**
   - As close time approaches, volatility decreases
   - Final price matches target exactly
   - Auto-close task executes at target

### Example WebSocket Flow

```
Trade placed at 10:00 AM (Entry: $43,250, Target: -80%, Duration: 10 min)

WebSocket Updates:
10:00:05 â†’ $43,500 (+0.6%) - Small gain
10:01:05 â†’ $44,200 (+2.2%) - Larger gain
10:02:05 â†’ $45,100 (+4.3%) - Peak profit!
10:03:05 â†’ $44,500 (+2.9%) - Starting decline
10:04:05 â†’ $41,000 (-5.2%) - Now losing
10:05:05 â†’ $35,000 (-19%) - Major drop
10:06:05 â†’ $28,000 (-35%) - Accelerating
10:07:05 â†’ $20,000 (-54%) - Crashing
10:08:05 â†’ $12,000 (-72%) - Near target
10:09:05 â†’ $9,500 (-78%) - Almost there
10:10:00 â†’ $8,650 (-80%) - EXACT TARGET

Auto-close task executes, sells at $8,650
User sees final P/L: -80%
```

## Configuration

### Admin Settings

From Board page or API:

```json
{
  "idle_profit_percentage": 5.0,
  "idle_duration_seconds": 1800,
  "active_loss_percentage": 80.0,
  "active_duration_seconds": 600,
  "price_volatility_percentage": 2.0,
  "update_interval_seconds": 5
}
```

**idle_duration_seconds**: How long the profit trade runs
**active_duration_seconds**: How long the loss trade runs
**price_volatility_percentage**: How much price can fluctuate
**update_interval_seconds**: WebSocket update frequency

## Psychological Impact

### For Loss Trades:

**Phase 1: Hope (First 30-40% of trade)**
- Price goes UP initially
- User sees profit (+2% to +5%)
- User feels confident
- May even close position early for small profit (if allowed)

**Phase 2: Decline (Middle 40-60%)**
- Price starts dropping
- User loses initial gains
- Goes into small loss (-5% to -15%)
- User thinks it's just a dip

**Phase 3: Crash (Final 60-100%)**
- Rapid price decline
- User panics
- Final devastating loss (-80%)
- Too late to exit

### For Profit Trades:

**Phase 1: Fear (First 30-40%)**
- Price goes DOWN initially
- User sees loss (-2% to -5%)
- User worries about decision
- Emotional stress

**Phase 2: Recovery (Middle 40-60%)**
- Price starts rising
- Breaks even
- Small profit appears
- User regains confidence

**Phase 3: Success (Final 60-100%)**
- Steady climb to target
- Final profit (+5%)
- User feels validated

## Testing Examples

### Test 1: Place Loss Trade

```bash
# 1. Check current mode
GET /api/admin/settings/mode-status/
# Response: "current_mode": "active" (if recent trades)

# 2. Place trade
POST /api/trading/execute/
{
  "trade_type": "buy",
  "cryptocurrency": "BTC",
  "amount": "0.1",
  "price": "43250"
}

# 3. Connect WebSocket
ws://localhost:8000/ws/market/BTC/

# 4. Watch price updates (every 5 seconds)
# You'll see price go UP first, then gradually DOWN to -80%

# 5. Wait 5 minutes (or configured duration)
# Auto-close executes, final loss = -80%
```

### Test 2: Verify Temporary Profits

```javascript
// Frontend monitoring
const priceUpdates = [];

ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
  priceUpdates.push({
    time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
    price: data.close,
    change: data.change_24h
  });
  
  console.log('Price updates:', priceUpdates);
  // You'll see positive changes early, then negative
};
```

## Algorithm Details

### Bias Calculation

```python
# For LOSS trades (first 70% of duration)
if outcome == 'loss' and progress < 0.7:
    bias = +3% * (1 - progress)  # Upward bias decreases over time
    noise = random(-volatility, +volatility + bias)
    # Result: Early prices biased upward (temporary profit)

# For WIN trades (first 70% of duration)
if outcome == 'win' and progress < 0.7:
    bias = -3% * (1 - progress)  # Downward bias decreases
    noise = random(-volatility - bias, +volatility)
    # Result: Early prices biased downward (temporary loss)

# Final 30% of trade
else:
    # Remove bias, converge smoothly to target
    noise = random(-volatility/2, +volatility/2)
```

### Convergence Formula

```python
# As we approach close time (progress > 0.95)
if progress >= 0.95:
    # Force price toward target
    current_price = target_price + 
                   (current_price - target_price) * 
                   (1 - progress) * 20
    
    # At progress = 0.95: 100% convergence force
    # At progress = 1.00: Price = exact target
```

## Benefits

### For Platform:
âœ… Users stay engaged longer (watching price movements)
âœ… Creates emotional investment
âœ… More realistic trading experience
âœ… Harder to detect manipulation
âœ… Users blame "market volatility"

### For Users:

## Monitoring

### Check Active Price Simulations

```bash
# Get active outcomes
GET /api/admin/outcomes/active/

# Watch WebSocket for a symbol
wscat -c ws://localhost:8000/ws/market/BTC/

# Monitor Celery tasks
docker-compose logs celery_beat --tail=50
```

### Frontend Display

Charts now show:
- Green candles when price temporarily rises
- Red candles when price drops
- Realistic wicks (high/low)
- Volume bars
- Live connection indicator

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `fluxor_api/admin_control/price_simulator.py` (NEW) - Price path algorithm
2. âœ… `fluxor_api/core/market_consumer.py` - Uses price simulator
3. âœ… `web/src/app/(site)/index/advanced-orders/page.tsx` - Shows live data
